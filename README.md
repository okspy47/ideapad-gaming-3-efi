# Hackintosh EFI for Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 (15ACH6)

### Notes:
- As I don't own the machine anymore, I can't contribute as much as I would want to. But, I'm open to active contributions to this repository that would provide updates to fix the issues described below.
- It may be one of the only shared EFIs for this Ryzen variant of the *Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3* Gaming Laptop, also one of my firsts EFIs created, so a Star would be much appreciated. ❤️

As a fact, I'm writting this from a MacBook Pro, as I decided to do the upgrade, and sold the Lenovo. All the photos are made a time ago, in different moments.
